    "[Finding Cheryl's birthday](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/science/a-math-problem-from-singapore-goes-viral-when-is-cheryls-birthday.html) is a fun puzzle. But what if the situation were more complex? What if apart from Albert and Bernard there was also Carl, and between the three of them they had to guess Cheryl's complete birthday, including the year she was born?\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy for solving such puzzles stays the same, but the paper-and-pencil approach quickly becomes tedious as the puzzles become more complex. Also, how would we come up with such puzzles in the first place? Going through a large list of possible permutations before arriving at an interesting version would be even more time consuming.\n",

    "Inspired by Peter Norvig's [IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/Cheryl.ipynb) on finding Cheryl's birthday in Python, [`cheryl`](https://github.com/bembom/cheryl) is a Python module for generating and solving such problems in a more general way."
